Score each answer on a scale of 1-10 and explain your scoring.

At the end of the interview, provide an overall assessment including:

## Setting up the Infrastructure

1. Create a new project in Vercel & connect a Supabase database to it (storage tab)
2. Once the database is connected, create a new table called `public.interviews`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.interviews (
  id text NOT NULL,
  name text NULL,
  feedback_history jsonb NULL,
  overall_feedback jsonb NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  CONSTRAINT interviews_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

3. Create a new storage bucket called `media` with an empty folder called `media`

## Setting up the Project

1. `pnpm install`
2. `cp .env.example .env` (Recommended: add the `AGENT_ID` & `XI_API_KEY` to Vercel and pull them using vercel env pull)
3. `pnpm run dev`
